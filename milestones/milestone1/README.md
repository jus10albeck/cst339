## Project Proposal and Sitemap

### Project Proposal

Within the last year, my wife and I have been building a collection of our favorite movies.   
We chose to start the collection for three reasons:  
1. We were sick of having to jump between 5 different streaming services to search for a movie that might not even be on any of them.
2. We want to know what our future children are watching, and the best way to do that is to avoid streaming services and build a library of a variety of movies that definitely uphold our values.
3. Streaming services are becoming too expensive, and prices just keep rising! Additionally, the crackdown on "password sharing" forces people to pay $7.99 for streaming with ads, and a whopping $17.99 for ad-free for Netflix (as of 1/23/2026). 

While it is fun stumbling upon a movie to add to the collection out in the wild, sometimes it is hard to keep track of what movies you own or still searching for. Sure, in a very digital centric world, physical media (DVD's and VHS) is dwindling in sales year over year, but there is still a niche market trying to build a physical collection.  
The first iteration of this application will be purely for physical movie collection/wishlist managing with standard CRUD functionality. I will also include functions like filtering, sub-collections (i.e kids collection), wishlist, and user accounts. This application does have potential to grow to other mediums—vinyl, CD's, cassette tapes, and books.
